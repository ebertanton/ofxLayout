ofxLayout
=========

A layout management framework for managing multiple drawable classes in openframeworks. It allows you to easily place any drawable class into a layout, like Row, Column, Overlay etc. This is based on my short experience with python Kivy. It also has a WIP layout language similar to kivy's kv language.

Depends:
ofxObservableProperty - An addon for creating variables which can be tracked globally via events. You can listen to changes in an int, bool, string etc property of a class.

ofxJSON - Used for storing the layout json config file

ofxPostProcessing - Used for Eye candy

ofx Animatable - Used for Eye candy
